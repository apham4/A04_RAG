This guideline was created to give healthcare professionals the latest clinical advice for caring for patients with food allergies, based on a thorough review of scientific research. This booklet summarizes that medical guidance into simple, plain language that is easy for patients, families, and caregivers to understand. The main goal is to empower people with the knowledge to manage food allergies effectively, leading to a better quality of life. It covers how to properly diagnose a food allergy, how to manage the condition long-term, and most importantly, how to recognize and treat severe, life-threatening allergic reactions.

A food allergy is a specific reaction by the body's immune system that happens consistently after eating a certain food. This is different from a food intolerance, such as lactose intolerance, which does not involve the immune system. In the United States, eight foods account for the majority of allergic reactions: milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts (like walnuts and almonds), soy, wheat, fish, and crustacean shellfish (like shrimp and crab). The parts of a food that trigger the immune system are called allergens, which are usually proteins that can cause reactions even after being cooked.

Food allergies can affect both children and adults. While many children will eventually outgrow their allergies to milk, egg, soy, and wheat, allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong. It is also common for people with a food allergy to have other related allergic conditions, such as eczema (atopic dermatitis), asthma, or eosinophilic esophagitis (a type of inflammation in the esophagus). A person with both a food allergy and asthma is at a higher risk of having a severe allergic reaction.

The process of diagnosing a food allergy starts with a doctor taking a detailed medical history and performing a physical exam. The doctor will ask about the specific symptoms that occurred, what food was eaten, how much of it was eaten, and how quickly the symptoms appeared after eating. While a medical history is very important for providing clues, it cannot be used by itself to make a diagnosis. It is important to have any suspected food allergy confirmed by a healthcare professional, as many people who believe they have a food allergy actually do not, and avoiding foods unnecessarily can affect nutrition and quality of life.

If a food allergy involving the antibody IgE is suspected, a doctor will likely recommend tests to help identify the problem food. The most common initial tests are a skin prick test (SPT) and a blood test for allergen-specific IgE (sIgE). For an SPT, a healthcare professional places a tiny drop of a liquid food extract on the skin and gently pricks the surface, and a positive test shows up as a small, raised, red bump called a wheal. The blood test measures the amount of IgE antibodies to a specific food in the bloodstream. It is very important for patients to understand that a positive SPT or sIgE blood test only proves sensitization, meaning the body has created antibodies to that food; it does not, on its own, confirm a food allergy.

The most definitive test to accurately diagnose or rule out a food allergy is called an oral food challenge. This test must always be conducted in a medical facility with staff who are trained to handle severe allergic reactions. During the challenge, the patient is given small, gradually increasing doses of the suspected food over a period of time and is watched closely for any symptoms. If the patient tolerates the food with no symptoms, the food allergy is ruled out. If the patient develops symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction, the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. This test is considered the "gold standard" because it is the most accurate way to know for sure if a food causes an allergy.
Once a food allergy is diagnosed, the primary management strategy is to strictly avoid eating the food that causes the reaction. Patients and families should receive education on how to carefully read food labels to identify ingredients. The guideline also suggests being cautious about products with voluntary advisory labels, such as "may contain trace amounts of allergen" or "made in a facility that also processes nuts," as these warnings are not regulated and the risk is often unclear. Currently, there are no approved medications or therapies that can prevent or cure food allergies, so avoidance remains the cornerstone of management.

To help prevent food allergies from developing in infants, the guideline provides important advice. It recommends that mothers should not restrict their own diets during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, as there is no evidence this helps prevent allergies in their children. The guidance also states that for most infants, there is no benefit to delaying the introduction of solid foods, including common allergens like milk, egg, and peanut products, beyond 4 to 6 months of age.

The most serious and dangerous health problem that can result from a food allergy is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This reaction can happen very quickly and can be life-threatening. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can involve several parts of the body at once and may include widespread hives or skin redness, swelling of the lips and tongue, trouble breathing or wheezing, vomiting or cramps, and a sudden drop in blood pressure that can lead to dizziness or fainting. Any combination of these symptoms that appears within minutes to hours of eating a food should be treated as a medical emergency.

In the event of an anaphylactic reaction, the main life-saving treatment is an immediate injection of the medication epinephrine. Epinephrine works quickly to reverse the most dangerous symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as airway swelling and low blood pressure. It is given as an injection into the outer thigh muscle, most commonly using an auto-injector device. The guideline stresses that any delay in administering epinephrine is associated with an increased risk of death. Antihistamines, such as Benadryl, can help with milder symptoms like hives, but they cannot stop a severe anaphylactic reaction and must never be used as a substitute for epinephrine.

Every person with a diagnosed food allergy should have an Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan, which is a written document from their doctor that details exactly what to do in an emergency. The key steps are: 1) Inject epinephrine immediately at the first sign of a severe reaction. 2) Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency medical service. The patient should then be transported to an emergency department for further treatment and observation, as symptoms can sometimes return hours after the initial reaction.

The single biggest danger associated with food allergy is underestimating the severity of a reaction and delaying the use of epinephrine. The most important safety tip is for anyone with a diagnosed food allergy to always carry two epinephrine auto-injectors with them and to know exactly how and when to use them. Family members, friends, and caregivers should also be trained on how to recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis and how to administer epinephrine, in case the person having the reaction is unable to do it themselves. It is impossible to predict how severe any given reaction will be, even if past reactions have been mild.
