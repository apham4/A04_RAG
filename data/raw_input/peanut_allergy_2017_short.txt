Summary:
Peanut allergy represents a significant and escalating public health concern, impacting a growing number of children and adults and posing a risk of severe, potentially life-threatening reactions. Its prevalence in the U.S. has risen from 0.4% in children in 1999 to approximately 2% by 2010. Given that peanut allergy often manifests early in life and tends to be lifelong, cost-effective prevention strategies are crucial for public health, reducing suffering, and lowering healthcare costs.

Prompted by emerging data, particularly the landmark "Learning Early about Peanut Allergy" (LEAP) trial, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in collaboration with 25 professional organizations, federal agencies, and patient advocacy groups, developed Addendum Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy. These guidelines aim to provide clear recommendations for healthcare providers on the early introduction of peanut-containing foods to reduce allergy risk.

The Addendum provides three distinct guidelines tailored to infants of varying risk levels. Guideline 1 focuses on high-risk infants, defined as those with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. For this group, the expert panel strongly recommends introducing age-appropriate peanut-containing foods as early as 4 to 6 months of age, but only after other solid foods have been successfully introduced to confirm developmental readiness. Pre-introduction evaluation with peanut-specific IgE and/or skin prick testing is strongly considered to determine the optimal introduction method.

The LEAP trial provided compelling evidence for Guideline 1, demonstrating a significant reduction in peanut allergy prevalence in infants who consumed peanuts early. For instance, among infants with negative baseline skin tests to peanut, early consumption led to an 86.1% relative reduction in peanut allergy prevalence at 60 months of age compared to avoidance. The LEAP-On study further showed the durability of this achieved oral tolerance. The guidelines also detail how to proceed based on testing results, recommending home introduction for low-risk infants and supervised feedings or oral food challenges for those with higher sensitization levels, managed by a specialist.

Guideline 2 suggests that infants with mild to moderate eczema should introduce age-appropriate peanut-containing foods around 6 months of age, aligned with family preferences and cultural practices, to reduce allergy risk. This can typically be done at home without an in-office evaluation, though supervised feeding remains an option if desired. Guideline 3 recommends that infants without eczema or any food allergy can have age-appropriate peanut-containing foods freely introduced into their diet alongside other solid foods, in accordance with family preferences. This is based on the lack of evidence for restricting allergenic foods in this low-risk group and the understanding that early introduction can still contribute to reducing the overall societal burden of peanut allergy.

The guidelines also address several important considerations. They note that early peanut introduction did not negatively impact breastfeeding duration or frequency. While the 4-6 month window is ideal for high-risk infants, older infants can still benefit from early introduction. For families with existing peanut allergy, discussion with healthcare providers is advised to weigh the benefits and risks of introducing peanut to the infant. Finally, children confirmed to be peanut allergic should strictly avoid peanuts and remain under specialist care.
