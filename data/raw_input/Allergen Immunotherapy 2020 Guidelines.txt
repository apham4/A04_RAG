This user's guide provides a detailed and practical overview of allergen immunotherapy, a specialized treatment for allergic diseases. Its primary purpose is to give healthcare professionals, particularly those caring for children, the most up-to-date, evidence-based information on how to use this therapy effectively and safely. The document addresses the significant impact of common allergic conditions like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic asthma, and explains how immunotherapy can offer a long-term solution. A major theme is the importance of precision and personalization in treatment, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to tailor therapy to the individual patient's specific allergy profile.

Allergen immunotherapy, often called allergy shots or allergy drops, is the only treatment available that can modify the natural course of an allergic disease rather than just temporarily relieving symptoms. It works by gradually introducing the body to small, controlled amounts of an allergen, which helps the immune system build tolerance over time. This guide is intended for children and adolescents with diagnosed IgE-mediated allergies, meaning allergies that are confirmed to be driven by a specific antibody called Immunoglobulin E. The primary conditions addressed are allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma caused by common inhaled allergens like pollens and house dust mites, as well as severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to insect stings.

The process of identifying a patient who is a good candidate for immunotherapy begins with a thorough clinical history and diagnostic testing. A doctor will confirm the allergy by identifying the presence of specific IgE antibodies to a suspected allergen. This is typically done with a skin prick test, where a tiny amount of allergen extract is applied to the skin, or with a blood test. A key advance discussed in the guide is component-resolved diagnosis (CRD), a more detailed type of blood test that can identify the specific proteins, or molecules, within an allergen source (like grass pollen) that a person is allergic to. This molecular-level diagnosis helps distinguish between a true, primary sensitization and a cross-reaction, leading to a more precise selection of the immunotherapy product.

The most common method of administering immunotherapy is through subcutaneous injections (SCIT), also known as allergy shots, which are given in a doctor's office. An alternative and increasingly common method is sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), where the allergen is given as a tablet or liquid drop placed under the tongue to be taken at home. The guide reviews the evidence for both methods, noting that while both are effective, SCIT may have a slight edge in efficacy, whereas SLIT has a significantly better safety profile with a much lower risk of causing a severe systemic reaction. The choice between SCIT and SLIT depends on many factors, including the specific allergen, the patient's age and co-existing conditions, and family preferences regarding convenience and adherence.

A critical aspect of immunotherapy is the management of potential adverse reactions. While local reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site for SCIT, or oral itching for SLIT, are common and generally mild, there is a small but real risk of a severe, life-threatening systemic reaction known as anaphylaxis, particularly with allergy shots. For this reason, SCIT must always be administered in a medical setting equipped to manage such an emergency. Patients receiving SCIT are required to wait in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after their injection for observation. While the risk of anaphylaxis with SLIT is extremely rare, it is recommended that the very first dose be given under medical supervision.

The guide emphasizes the importance of patient and family education. Before starting treatment, the clinician must have a detailed discussion about the process, including the schedule of administration, the expected duration of treatment (typically three to five years), the potential benefits, and the possible side effects. Adherence to the treatment schedule is critical for success, and this long-term commitment requires a strong partnership between the family and the healthcare team. Patients with co-existing conditions, particularly asthma, must have their asthma well-controlled before starting immunotherapy, as uncontrolled asthma is an absolute contraindication to this treatment.

To prevent future problems and stay safe during treatment, patients and families are instructed on how to manage their allergies day-to-day. This includes continuing with allergen avoidance measures where possible and using regular allergy medications as prescribed, especially during the initial phase of immunotherapy. For those on allergy shots, it is important to communicate any illness or recent symptoms to the clinic staff before receiving an injection, as the dose may need to be adjusted. For those on sublingual therapy at home, they should be taught when to temporarily withhold their dose, such as during an oral infection or an asthma exacerbation.

One of the most exciting aspects of allergen immunotherapy discussed is its potential to prevent the progression of allergic disease, often referred to as the "atopic march." The guide highlights strong evidence showing that immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis in children with pollen allergies can significantly reduce their risk of developing asthma later on. This preventive effect is a major consideration when deciding to start therapy, especially in younger children, and may justify its use in children with milder rhinitis symptoms to potentially alter the long-term course of their allergic disease.

The most significant danger to be aware of during immunotherapy is the risk of anaphylaxis. The guideline stresses that this risk is highest during the build-up phase of SCIT when the doses are being increased. To keep patients safe, AIT should only be prescribed and administered by physicians with expertise in allergy and the management of anaphylaxis. The most important practical safety tip for patients is to remain at the clinic for the full observation period after an injection and to always have access to an epinephrine auto-injector if one has been prescribed for a pre-existing severe allergy.

This user's guide also looks to the future of immunotherapy, discussing the development of new and improved treatments. This includes the use of adjuvants, which are substances added to the allergen extract to enhance the immune system's response, making the therapy more effective and potentially shortening the treatment duration. Novel routes of administration, such as epicutaneous (on the skin) and intralymphatic (directly into a lymph node) immunotherapy, are also being investigated with the goal of improving both efficacy and patient convenience.
