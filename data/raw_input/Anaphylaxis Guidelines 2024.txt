Guideline Title: Anaphylaxis in Practice: A Guide to the 2023 Practice Parameter Update
Publishing Organization & Date: Published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, 2024, as a guide to the 2023 JTFPP update.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to summarize the most clinically impactful new research and practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis, as presented in the comprehensive 2023 Anaphylaxis Practice Parameter Update from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters. The scope includes evolving diagnostic criteria, the role and interpretation of tryptase measurements, specific considerations for anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers, and management strategies in community and healthcare settings. It is intended to be a high-level guide for practicing clinicians.

Patient Population:
The patient population covered is broad, encompassing individuals of all ages who present with or are at risk for anaphylaxis. The guideline provides specific recommendations and highlights unique considerations for different populations, including a dedicated focus on infants and toddlers, who may present with atypical symptoms. It also addresses patients with recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis and those with underlying conditions such as mast cell disorders.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The guideline provides a detailed description of the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. It reinforces the NIAID/FAAN criteria, which define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. The diagnosis is clinical, based on recognizing a pattern of symptoms across multiple organ systems. Key symptoms of an acute reaction include cutaneous manifestations like urticaria (hives), flushing, pruritus, or angioedema. These are often accompanied by either respiratory compromise, such as dyspnea, wheeze, bronchospasm, stridor, or hypoxemia, or by a sudden drop in blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction like syncope, collapse, or incontinence. The guideline specifically highlights that for infants and toddlers, the clinical presentation can be subtle and challenging to recognize, with key signs including sudden behavioral changes, inconsolable crying, flushing, and vomiting.

For diagnostic evaluation, the parameter provides an updated, more specific rule for interpreting serum tryptase levels. A clinically relevant increase in tryptase during an acute event is now defined as being greater than 20% above the patient's baseline serum tryptase level plus 2 ng/mL. The guideline strongly recommends obtaining a baseline tryptase level in patients who experience recurrent, severe, or idiopathic anaphylaxis to screen for underlying conditions like hereditary alpha-tryptasemia or a clonal mast cell disorder. It also suggests considering an allergy to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) in cases of recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis, particularly those with a delayed onset of symptoms after eating red meat.

The core recommendation for acute treatment is unequivocal: intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line, life-saving therapy and should be administered promptly at the first sign of a suspected anaphylactic reaction. The guideline explicitly states that clinicians should not delay treatment to wait for full diagnostic criteria to be met. Conversely, it also clarifies that the clinical decision to administer epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate marker to definitively diagnose anaphylaxis, as it is often appropriately used for milder reactions that do not meet formal criteria.

For long-term management and prevention, the key strategy is the prescription of self-injectable epinephrine to all patients at risk. This must be accompanied by comprehensive education on allergen avoidance, recognition of early symptoms, and a written emergency action plan detailing exactly when and how to use the device and when to seek emergency medical services. The guideline supports shared decision-making between the clinician and patient to determine when home management after epinephrine use is appropriate versus automatic activation of emergency medical services. It also recommends that childcare centers and schools have stock undesignated epinephrine autoinjectors and trained staff to manage anaphylactic emergencies.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The most critical safety warning in the guideline is that delaying the administration of epinephrine is a primary risk factor for morbidity and mortality in anaphylaxis. Any hesitation in using epinephrine when anaphylaxis is suspected should be avoided. The document also implicitly warns against the over-reliance on second-line medications like antihistamines and corticosteroids for the acute management of severe symptoms, as they do not reverse the life-threatening respiratory and cardiovascular manifestations of anaphylaxis.
