Summary:

This practice parameter, a joint effort by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI), serves as a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for clinicians on the diagnostic testing for allergic diseases.  The document’s primary goal is to integrate the technological advancements of the past decade into clinical practice, providing a reliable framework for selecting, utilizing, and interpreting various diagnostic tests to enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of patient care. 

A cornerstone of allergy diagnosis remains the in vivo skin tests for IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. The parameter details the methodologies for prick/puncture and intracutaneous tests, emphasizing them as reliable and primary tools.  It underscores the importance of using potent, stable allergen extracts and concurrently applying positive (histamine) and negative (saline) controls to ensure accurate interpretation.  While prick/puncture tests are recommended for the initial evaluation of most common allergies, the more sensitive intracutaneous tests are highlighted as particularly valuable for diagnosing anaphylactic sensitivity to certain drugs, like penicillin, and to Hymenoptera venom. 

The document also provides a thorough overview of in vitro tests, primarily serum assays for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These assays are standardized against a World Health Organization (WHO) international reference, which allows for uniform, quantitative reporting of results.  The parameter notes that while these blood tests are advantageous in specific clinical scenarios—such as for patients with widespread skin conditions or for those unable to stop medications that interfere with skin testing—they generally have a lower predictive value compared to skin tests for most allergens.  The guide also explicitly states that measuring IgG or IgG4 antibodies to foods is not a valid or clinically relevant method for diagnosing food allergies. 

Organ challenge tests, including conjunctival, nasal, and bronchial challenges, are presented as the definitive "gold standard" for confirming the clinical relevance of a sensitization, particularly when a patient's history is strongly suggestive but skin or blood test results are inconclusive.  The parameter provides detailed guidelines for conducting these tests, stressing that they should be performed in a controlled, medically supervised environment. These procedures are crucial for research purposes and for substantiating occupational allergies. 

For diagnosing cell-mediated allergic conditions, such as allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the epicutaneous patch test is the definitive diagnostic method.  The guide provides detailed instructions on the application, reading, and interpretation of patch tests, including the use of standardized screening panels like the T.R.U.E. TEST. It carefully distinguishes ACD from irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), which is a non-allergic reaction, and provides context for diagnosing these conditions in various settings, including the workplace. 

The parameter offers specific, evidence-based strategies for diagnosing a wide range of allergic conditions. For suspected food allergies, the diagnostic process involves a combination of a detailed patient history, skin prick tests, serum-specific IgE testing, and, most definitively, oral food challenges.  For stinging insect allergies, a diagnosis is confirmed through a combination of a clear history of a systemic reaction and positive venom-specific skin or IgE tests.  In the case of drug allergies, particularly to penicillin, skin testing with both major and minor determinants is identified as the most reliable method for evaluating immediate, IgE-mediated reactions. 

The document also provides a critical evaluation of unproven and investigational diagnostic tests. It strongly advises against the use of methods that lack scientific validation, such as cytotoxic tests, electrodermal testing, applied kinesiology, and food-specific IgG/IgG4 antibody testing, as these are not supported by evidence.  Newer methods, such as the atopy patch test (APT), are discussed as promising investigational tools that may have future applications but currently lack the standardization needed for routine clinical use. 

In its concluding remarks, the practice parameter reiterates that the diagnosis of an allergic disorder is a multifaceted process that should not rely on a single test. It requires the skillful integration of a thorough clinical history, a physical examination, and the thoughtful application of validated diagnostic tests. The choice of tests should always be tailored to the individual patient's clinical presentation, and the results must be interpreted in the full context of their history and symptoms. By following these principles, clinicians can achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis, leading to improved management and a better quality of care for patients with allergic diseases.
