Summary:

This user's guide from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) offers a detailed and up-to-date overview of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for children, with a focus on practical implications for both research and clinical practice.  Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is presented as the only specific and disease-modifying treatment for allergic conditions.  It has been shown to not only improve symptoms and reduce medication needs but also to induce specific tolerance that persists beyond the treatment period and can prevent the development of new allergic conditions.  The guide covers the use of AIT in children for rhinitis, asthma, food, and venom allergies, with a specific focus on inhalant allergens and insect venom. 

The guide delves into the immunological mechanisms that underpin the clinical efficacy of AIT.  AIT works by inducing allergen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells that release suppressor cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β, creating a suppressive environment that downregulates the allergic immune response.  This process involves the modulation of T- and B-cell responses, a shift in antibody isotypes with a decrease in IgE and an increase in IgG4, and a reduction in the activation of mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils.  The cumulative effect is the induction of long-term, allergen-specific immune tolerance, leading to a reduction in allergic inflammation and symptoms. 

The guide provides a thorough review of the evidence for AIT in treating allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma in children. For AR, there is good quality evidence supporting the use of specific AIT products as an effective treatment for children and adolescents.  The clinical efficacy of house dust mite (HDM) AIT in AR is well-established for reducing symptoms and medication use, especially in children with moderate-to-severe AR.  In the case of asthma, the evidence for AIT in children is promising, particularly in its ability to reduce asthma symptoms and medication use, both during and after treatment.  The benefits of HDM-AIT in children with HDM-induced asthma are well-documented, especially for those with persistent asthma, normal lung function, and concurrent AR. 

A significant focus of the guide is on the preventive effects of AIT. It highlights evidence suggesting that AIT can prevent the development of asthma in children with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis, with this protective effect lasting for at least two years after treatment completion.  This asthma preventive effect is a key consideration when deciding on AIT for children with AR.  The guide suggests that this potential for prevention should be discussed with patients and could influence the decision to start AIT even in cases of milder AR.  However, the guide also notes that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend AIT for the prevention of new allergic sensitizations in any population. 

The practical aspects of prescribing AIT in children are extensively covered, including the choice between subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) administration routes. Both methods have been studied extensively and have their own pros and cons, with the choice often depending on the patient's profile.  The guide emphasizes the importance of using standardized AIT products with documented clinical efficacy.  It also discusses the influence of geographical and sociological diversity on pollen allergy phenotypes and prescription approaches, noting that patients in Southern Europe, particularly in Mediterranean dry areas, often present with more complex sensitization profiles. 

The role of biomarkers in AIT is another key theme. The guide discusses how molecular diagnostics, such as component-resolved diagnosis (CRD), can improve decision-making by distinguishing between genuine sensitizations and cross-reactivity, thus informing AIT prescription on an individual level.  For instance, certain allergenic molecules can serve as biomarkers for the risk of allergic asthma or oral allergy syndrome.  The guide also looks to the future, suggesting that mobile health technologies and e-Diaries can be valuable tools for assessing the clinical relevance of serological test results and monitoring symptoms, paving the way for a new era of precision medicine in allergy practice. 

Finally, the guide addresses AIT for less common aeroallergens and venom allergies. It notes that there is limited high-quality evidence to support the use of AIT for allergens such as animal dander, molds, and cockroaches, especially in children.  For Hymenoptera venom allergy, which is a leading cause of anaphylaxis in childhood, venom immunotherapy (VIT) is presented as a highly effective treatment that protects a large percentage of allergic patients.  However, the guide calls for further studies to investigate the clinical effectiveness and optimal duration of VIT in children. 

In conclusion, the EAACI Allergen Immunotherapy User's Guide serves as a comprehensive resource for healthcare professionals, providing an up-to-date overview of the key aspects of AIT in children. It emphasizes that clinical decision-making should be informed by the latest evidence on indications, products, and expected outcomes.  The guide points towards a future where precision medicine, incorporating molecular approaches and e-health technology, could significantly improve health outcomes for children receiving AIT.  It also highlights the need for high-quality randomized controlled trials in children to address current knowledge gaps and further solidify the evidence base for AIT use in the pediatric population.
