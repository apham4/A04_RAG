This document serves as a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for doctors, aiming to standardize the use of allergy tests by incorporating technological advances and new scientific knowledge. Its purpose is to help clinicians select the most appropriate diagnostic tests, use them in a cost-effective way, and interpret the results accurately to improve the quality of care for patients with a wide range of hypersensitivity disorders.

The guideline is written primarily for allergists and clinical immunologists, but its principles are essential for any patient or family navigating the world of allergy diagnosis. It covers testing for all major types of allergies, including those to inhaled substances like pollen and mold, foods, insect stings, drugs, and chemicals that cause skin rashes upon contact. The parameter details a wide variety of testing methods and provides guidance on how to integrate the results with a patient's medical history to arrive at an accurate diagnosis, which is the necessary first step for creating an effective management plan that might include medication, environmental controls, or allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots).

The document divides allergy tests into two main categories: in vivo tests, which are performed on the body, and in vitro tests, which are performed on a blood sample in a laboratory. The most common in vivo test, and the preferred starting point for diagnosing immediate allergies like hay fever, is the skin prick or puncture test. This test involves placing a drop of a purified allergen extract on the skin, usually on the back or forearm, and then making a tiny break in the skin's surface with a small, sharp instrument. If a person is sensitized to that allergen, their skin will produce a raised, red, itchy bump called a wheal and flare within 15 to 20 minutes. This reaction confirms the presence of allergy-related antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE), but a positive result by itself does not automatically mean a person is clinically allergic; it must be correlated with their symptoms.

When a skin prick test result is negative but the doctor still strongly suspects an allergy, a more sensitive in vivo method called the intracutaneous or intradermal test may be used. This involves injecting a small amount of a much more diluted allergen solution just under the skin to form a small bleb. This type of test is particularly useful for evaluating potentially severe allergies to insect venom and certain drugs like penicillin. While it is more sensitive, it also carries a higher risk of producing a false-positive reaction due to irritation and is more likely to cause a systemic allergic reaction than a prick test. For this reason, intracutaneous testing is typically performed only after a prick test result for the same allergen is negative.

Another key in vivo diagnostic tool is the patch test, which is the definitive method for identifying the cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that causes an eczema-like rash. This is different from immediate allergies and is mediated by immune cells called T-cells, not IgE antibodies. During a patch test, small chambers containing suspected chemical allergens, such as nickel, fragrances, or rubber additives, are taped to the patient's back for 48 hours. The skin is then checked for a localized inflammatory reaction at 48 hours and again at 72 to 96 hours, as these reactions develop slowly.

For situations where skin and blood tests are not conclusive, the guideline identifies organ challenge tests as the "gold standard" for confirming a clinical allergy. These tests must be performed under strict medical supervision because they are designed to safely reproduce a patient's symptoms. An oral food challenge, for example, involves giving a patient gradually increasing doses of a suspected food and observing them for any reaction. A negative challenge, where the person eats a full serving of the food with no symptoms, definitively rules out that food allergy. Similar challenges can be done for inhaled allergens through nasal or bronchial routes to confirm triggers for rhinitis or asthma.

In vitro tests, or blood tests, provide another way to detect sensitization. The most common of these is the allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) blood test, which measures the amount of IgE antibodies to particular allergens circulating in the blood. These tests are particularly useful when skin testing cannot be performed, such as in patients with severe skin conditions or those who cannot stop taking antihistamine medication. While generally less sensitive than skin tests, sIgE tests have become more reliable over time. For several major food allergens, such as peanut, egg, and milk, research has shown that very high levels of specific IgE antibodies correlate strongly with a high probability of a true clinical allergy, which can sometimes reduce the need for a potentially risky oral food challenge.

A fundamental principle stressed throughout the guideline is that a positive allergy test of any kind—skin or blood—only indicates "sensitization," not necessarily a clinical allergy. This means the person's immune system has created IgE antibodies to a substance, but they may not experience any symptoms upon exposure to it. An accurate diagnosis of a clinical allergy can only be made when a positive test result is supported by a clear and consistent history of symptoms following exposure to that specific allergen. Therefore, management decisions, such as starting allergy shots or undertaking a restrictive diet, should never be based solely on test results without this essential clinical correlation.

The guideline places a strong emphasis on the safety of diagnostic testing. The most significant danger is the potential for a severe, life-threatening systemic reaction, or anaphylaxis, which can be triggered by the testing itself. While this risk is very low with skin prick testing, it is higher with intracutaneous testing and organ challenges. To ensure patient safety, these tests should only be performed by trained professionals in a setting equipped to manage emergency reactions. Another safety issue highlighted is the use of medications that can interfere with test results; for example, antihistamines can suppress skin test reactions, and patients should be instructed to stop them for an appropriate period before testing.

One of the most critical safety warnings is a strong admonition against the use of unproven and non-validated diagnostic procedures. The document lists several of these, including cytotoxic food tests, provocation-neutralization, applied kinesiology, electrodermal testing, iridology, hair analysis, and food-specific IgG or IgG4 antibody testing. The expert panel states clearly that these methods have no scientific validity, their results are not reproducible, and they do not correlate with clinical evidence of allergy. Relying on these unproven tests can lead to incorrect diagnoses, unnecessary and potentially harmful dietary restrictions, and wasted healthcare resources.
