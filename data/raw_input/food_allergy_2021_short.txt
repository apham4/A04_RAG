Summary:
Food allergy is a significant health concern that can cause reactions ranging from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. To address this, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in collaboration with 34 organizations, developed comprehensive guidelines for healthcare professionals. This booklet serves as a summary of those guidelines, empowering patients, families, and caregivers with essential knowledge to manage food allergy and improve their quality of life. It defines various aspects of food allergy and outlines diagnostic and management approaches.

A food allergy is defined as an adverse immune response that occurs reproducibly upon exposure to a specific food. Food allergens, typically proteins, trigger reactions when recognized by immune cells. Food allergies can be categorized as IgE-mediated, involving Immunoglobulin E antibodies, or non-IgE-mediated, where the immune system interacts with the allergen without IgE involvement. It is crucial to distinguish food allergies from food intolerances, such as lactose intolerance, which do not involve the immune system.

Food allergy is prevalent in the United States, affecting about 5% of children under five and 4% of older children and adults. The eight major food allergens are milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and crustacean shellfish. While many children outgrow allergies to milk, egg, soy, and wheat, fewer outgrow peanut and tree nut allergies, and allergies can also develop in adulthood. Individuals with food allergies are at higher risk for conditions like asthma and eczema, and asthma can increase the risk of severe allergic reactions.

Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy typically involves a medical history, physical examination, and specific tests. Healthcare professionals consider symptoms appearing minutes to hours after eating a food, particularly if anaphylaxis or other multi-system reactions occur. While skin prick/puncture tests (SPTs) and allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) blood tests can identify sensitization, they alone are insufficient for diagnosis; clinical symptoms must also be present. The oral food challenge test, carefully conducted in a medical facility due to risk, is considered the gold standard for confirming a food allergy diagnosis.

Diagnosis of non-IgE-mediated food allergy can be more challenging and often involves medical history combined with food elimination diets and oral food challenges. These allergies are associated with disorders such as Eosinophilic GI diseases (EGIDs), Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), and Food Protein-Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (AP). Specific diagnostic approaches are recommended for each, emphasizing the importance of symptom resolution upon avoidance and recurrence upon reintroduction.

The primary management strategy for diagnosed food allergies is strict avoidance of the allergenic food. Nutritional counseling and regular growth monitoring are recommended for children with food allergies. Patients are advised to learn how to read food labels, as the U.S. Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 mandates listing of eight major allergens; however, warning labels like "may contain trace amounts" are voluntary. Currently, no medications are available to prevent IgE- or non-IgE-mediated food allergy, and immunotherapy is not routinely recommended due to uncertain safety and unproven long-term benefit.

The guidelines also provide recommendations for vaccinations for individuals with egg allergy. While egg-allergic children, even those with a history of severe reactions, are recommended to receive Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) and MMR with Varicella (MMRV) vaccines due to their very low egg protein content. However, for influenza, rabies, and yellow fever vaccines, specific caution or evaluation by a healthcare professional is advised due to varying egg protein levels and potential risks, although some alternative vaccines like Imovax rabies vaccine are safe for egg-allergic individuals.
