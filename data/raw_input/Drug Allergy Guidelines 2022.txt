Guideline Title: Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update
Publishing Organization & Date: Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP). Published in 2022.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this practice parameter is to provide an updated, evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity reactions. The scope is comprehensive, covering a wide range of drug classes including beta-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, NSAIDs, chemotherapy agents, and biologics. A primary goal of the update is to shift clinical practice towards a more active approach of "delabeling" incorrect penicillin allergies through a new emphasis on risk stratification based on the patient's clinical history, and the preferential use of direct drug challenges over skin testing in many low-risk situations.

Patient Population:
The patient population includes adults and children with a reported or suspected allergy to a medication. The guideline addresses patients with a wide variety of reaction histories, from mild cutaneous rashes to severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis, and provides specific pathways for evaluating each type. It is intended for use by allergists, immunologists, and other physicians who manage patients with drug allergy labels.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The guideline differentiates drug allergy symptoms based on the underlying immunologic mechanism and timing, which is crucial for diagnosis and management. Immediate, IgE-mediated reactions typically occur within one to six hours of drug administration and present with symptoms such as urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling), flushing, pruritus, bronchospasm, and potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. Delayed, T-cell-mediated reactions occur hours to weeks after drug initiation. The most common presentation is a maculopapular exanthem (MPE), a generally benign rash. The parameter also distinguishes these from the far more dangerous Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs), which include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). These SCARs have distinct clinical presentations involving blistering, mucosal erosion, fever, and internal organ involvement.

The cornerstone of the updated diagnostic evaluation is a risk stratification based on the patient's reported clinical history and symptoms. For a reported penicillin allergy, if the historical symptoms were determined to be low-risk (e.g., a remote MPE, isolated pruritus, gastrointestinal intolerance, or a vague family history), the guideline now suggests proceeding directly to a one- or two-step oral challenge with amoxicillin, bypassing skin testing altogether. This is a major shift in practice. In contrast, if the reported symptoms were high-risk for an IgE-mediated reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema), then the recommended first step in the evaluation is penicillin skin testing. A positive skin test confirms sensitization. A negative skin test, however, has a very high negative predictive value and should be followed by a graded oral drug challenge to definitively rule out the allergy and remove the label. This risk-based pathway is designed to be safer and more efficient than previous approaches.

For acute treatment, the guideline states that the first step for any suspected drug reaction is the immediate withdrawal of the offending agent. Subsequent treatment is symptom-directed, such as using intramuscular epinephrine for anaphylaxis or antihistamines and corticosteroids for less severe reactions like urticaria or MPE. Long-term management strategies are diverse and depend entirely on the confirmed diagnosis. For a patient with a definitively confirmed, clinically significant allergy, the primary strategy is strict avoidance of the culprit drug and any known cross-reactive medications. For the vast majority of patients who are "delabeled" after a negative evaluation, management consists of removing the incorrect allergy from their medical records and educating them that the drug is safe for future use. For the unique situation where a patient has a confirmed IgE-mediated allergy to a drug that is essential and has no suitable alternative (a common scenario in oncology and infectious disease), the guideline recommends drug desensitization. This is a specialized procedure involving the administration of gradually increasing doses of the drug over several hours under close medical supervision to induce a state of temporary tolerance, allowing the patient to complete their necessary course of treatment.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
All procedures involving the re-exposure of a patient to a potentially allergenic drug, including skin testing, direct oral challenges, and especially drug desensitization, must be performed by clinicians with expertise in allergy and in a setting that is fully equipped to manage severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. A history suggestive of a Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (SCAR) like SJS or TEN is an absolute contraindication to any form of re-exposure, including skin testing or challenges, with the suspected drug due to the risk of a severe and potentially fatal recurrence.
