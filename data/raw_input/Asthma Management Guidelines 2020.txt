Guideline Title: 2020 Focused Updates to the Asthma Management Guidelines: A Report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group
Publishing Organization & Date: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Published December 2020.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this report is to provide focused, evidence-based updates to the 2007 EPR-3 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. The scope of the update is intentionally narrow, addressing only six specific, high-priority clinical questions determined by a needs assessment and the state of the science. These six areas are: the use of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) testing, the role of indoor allergen mitigation, the use of intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the addition of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), the role of immunotherapy, and the utility of bronchial thermoplasty.

Patient Population:
The patient population covered by these focused updates includes individuals with or suspected of having asthma across different age groups, with specific recommendations often stratified for ages 0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12 years and older. The recommendations apply to patients with varying levels of asthma severity, from mild intermittent to severe persistent asthma, depending on the specific clinical question being addressed.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
This focused update addresses several key areas of diagnosis and management without redefining the core symptoms of asthma. For diagnostic evaluation in patients aged 5 and older where the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain, the guideline conditionally recommends the use of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) measurement as an adjunct tool. This test helps identify eosinophilic airway inflammation, a key feature of T2-high asthma, and can support a diagnosis. The recommendation is conditional and based on moderate-certainty evidence.

The most significant update to treatment strategy is the strong recommendation for Single Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART) for patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. This approach involves using a single combination inhaler containing an ICS and formoterol (a fast-acting LABA) for both daily maintenance dosing and as-needed for relief of acute symptoms. This strategy is strongly recommended for patients aged 12 and older (high-certainty evidence) and conditionally recommended for ages 4-11 (moderate-certainty evidence) as being superior to regimens that use a separate short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for relief. Another key treatment update involves Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists (LAMAs). For patients aged 12 and older with uncontrolled asthma already on an ICS-LABA combination, the guideline conditionally recommends adding a LAMA to the regimen to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations.

The guideline also provides updated recommendations on adjunctive and non-pharmacologic therapies. It conditionally recommends subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) as an add-on treatment for patients aged 5 and older with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma, provided their asthma is well-controlled. In contrast, it conditionally recommends against the routine use of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of asthma. Regarding environmental control, the guideline recommends against indoor allergen mitigation strategies that involve multiple components and significant cost, as the evidence for their effectiveness in improving asthma outcomes is low. Finally, for adults aged 18 and older with persistent asthma, the guideline conditionally recommends against the procedural intervention of bronchial thermoplasty, citing a low certainty of evidence for a favorable balance of benefit versus harm. For young children (0-4 years) with recurrent wheezing triggered by viral infections, a conditional recommendation is made for using a short course of daily ICS at the onset of the infection to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The recommendations are framed with safety as a key consideration. For subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), it is emphasized that the patient's asthma must be stable and well-controlled before initiating and during the course of therapy due to the risk of SCIT-induced asthma exacerbations. The recommendation against routine multi-component allergen mitigation was partly influenced by the potential for high cost and significant effort for patients without proven benefit. The recommendation against bronchial thermoplasty considers the procedural risks, including a short-term increase in asthma symptoms and exacerbations post-procedure.
