This guideline is a focused update to provide the most current, evidence-based advice for diagnosing and managing drug allergies.  It was created because our understanding of drug reactions has changed significantly since the last major update in 2010, with important new information on testing and treatment.  The main takeaway is a shift in approach, with a greater emphasis on using "drug challenges" instead of skin testing for many patients to confirm or rule out an allergy.  The guideline strongly promotes shared decision-making, where the patient and doctor work together to decide on the best plan based on the patient's specific reaction history and medical needs. 

This document is primarily written for allergist-immunologists and other healthcare providers, but its recommendations directly impact patients with reported drug allergies.  This summary translates the technical information into plain language for patients and their families, so they can better understand the evaluation process for suspected allergies to common medications like antibiotics, NSAIDs, chemotherapy agents, and biologics.  It applies to both children and adults with a history of various types of drug reactions. 

Doctors identify a potential drug allergy by carefully classifying the reaction based on its timing and symptoms.  Reactions are generally grouped into two types: immediate and delayed.  Immediate reactions, often caused by an antibody called IgE, happen quickly, usually within one to six hours of taking the drug, and can cause symptoms like hives, swelling (angioedema), wheezing, or a severe, life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.  Delayed reactions develop more slowly, from several hours to weeks after starting a drug.  Most delayed reactions are mild skin rashes, but some can be severe, involving fever, organ problems, and extensive blistering rashes; these are collectively known as Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs). 

The most reliable way to diagnose or rule out a drug allergy is often a procedure called a drug challenge, which is considered the "reference standard."  This involves giving the patient the medication in a controlled medical setting to see if they can tolerate it.  For low-risk situations, this can be done in one or two steps.  A one-step challenge involves giving a single, full treatment dose, while a two-step challenge involves giving a small fraction of the dose first (e.g., 10%), followed by the remaining amount if no reaction occurs.  Skin testing, where a tiny amount of the drug is applied to or injected into the skin, is still a valuable tool, but it is now recommended primarily for patients with a history of a severe, immediate reaction like anaphylaxis. 

A major focus of the guideline is the problem of penicillin allergy labels.  While about 10% of people report having a penicillin allergy, over 90% of them are not truly allergic when properly tested.  This incorrect label is a serious issue because it often leads doctors to prescribe different antibiotics that can be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive, which can result in worse patient outcomes, longer hospital stays, and the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Because of this, the guideline strongly recommends that a proactive effort be made to evaluate and "delabel" patients with a reported penicillin allergy whenever it is appropriate and safe to do so. 

To prevent future problems and safely remove incorrect allergy labels, the guideline offers clear pathways based on a person's reaction history.  For the majority of children and adults who had a mild skin rash (like hives or a morbilliform rash) from penicillin a long time ago, the guideline suggests performing a direct oral challenge with amoxicillin without any preceding skin tests.  This simple procedure can safely clear most people of the allergy label. If the past reaction was severe and suggestive of anaphylaxis, penicillin skin testing should be done first to assess the risk before a challenge.  Once a patient is delabeled, it is critical to communicate this status by updating all medical records and providing the patient with written documentation. 

The most critical safety advice is to always stratify risk based on the severity of the initial reaction. Severe reactions like anaphylaxis require expert evaluation, often with skin testing before any consideration of re-exposure.  Drug challenges are absolutely contraindicated, meaning they must not be performed, in patients with a history of SCARs, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), or DRESS, as re-exposure can be life-threatening.  In an emergency situation where a patient needs a drug they are allergic to, a procedure called "desensitization" can be used. This involves giving the drug in tiny, gradually increasing doses over several hours in a monitored setting, which allows the patient to tolerate the medication temporarily.  This is often used for essential treatments like chemotherapy but should only be done when there are no suitable alternatives. 

A key emergency to be aware of is anaphylaxis, a rapid and severe allergic reaction that can involve hives, swelling, trouble breathing, and a drop in blood pressure.  The evaluation of a potential drug allergy, especially with challenges or desensitization, must always be performed by trained professionals in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis immediately.  For some very high-risk procedures, such as challenging a biologic medication in a patient with a severe prior reaction, this might even take place in an intensive care unit (ICU).  The guideline does not detail a specific emergency action plan for patients, but it emphasizes that the entire evaluation process is built around patient safety, with contraindications and risk levels determining every step of the process.

For other common antibiotics, the guideline notes that cross-reactivity is less common than once believed.  Patients with a non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy can usually take cephalosporin antibiotics safely, especially if the drug has a different chemical structure (a dissimilar R1 side chain).  For "sulfa" antibiotic allergies with a low-risk history, a simple one-step challenge is now preferred over older, more complex protocols.  The guideline also clarifies that there is no cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and other non-antibiotic drugs that contain a sulfa component, like certain diuretics or diabetes medications. 

Allergies to NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like aspirin and ibuprofen are also addressed. These reactions are classified into different types, some of which involve cross-reactivity among all NSAIDs that block an enzyme called COX-1, while others are specific to a single drug.  A critical scenario is when a patient with a reported aspirin allergy needs it for a heart condition.  If the past reaction was not a respiratory one (AERD), the guideline suggests a simple two-step oral challenge to safely reintroduce aspirin, rather than a more complex desensitization.  For patients who need pain relief but have an NSAID allergy, a selective COX-2 inhibitor is often a safe alternative. 

Finally, the guideline acknowledges that on very rare occasions, an allergic reaction is caused not by the active drug itself, but by an inactive ingredient called an excipient.  Examples include polyethylene glycol (PEG) or carboxymethylcellulose.  This type of allergy is extremely uncommon and should only be suspected in a patient who has experienced anaphylaxis to two or more structurally different medications that happen to share a common excipient.  Testing for excipient allergy is complex and should be performed by a specialist.
