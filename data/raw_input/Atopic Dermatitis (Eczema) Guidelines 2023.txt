Guideline Title: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters GRADE- and Institute of Medicine-based recommendations
Publishing Organization & Date: AAAAI/ACAAI Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP). Published in 2023.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this guideline is to produce rigorous, evidence-based recommendations for the optimal treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema. The scope of the document is broad, covering a wide range of therapeutic interventions for AD, including foundational topical treatments, the use of bleach baths, the role of dietary changes, allergen immunotherapy, and the use of advanced systemic therapies. The guideline aims to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare decision-makers by providing clear, trustworthy recommendations based on a systematic review of the available evidence.

Patient Population:
The patient population covered is comprehensive, including infants, children, and adults with atopic dermatitis. The recommendations are stratified to address the full spectrum of disease severity, from mild AD that may respond to simple measures, to moderate and severe disease that requires more intensive and advanced therapies. The guideline is intended for use by all clinicians who manage patients with atopic dermatitis, including allergists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and primary care providers.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The guideline addresses the management of the core symptoms of atopic dermatitis, which are defined by essential features of intense pruritus (itch) and characteristic eczematous lesions. These skin lesions are described as varying in appearance and distribution according to the patient's age and the chronicity of the disease. In acute phases, symptoms include erythema (redness), weeping or oozing papules and vesicles. In chronic phases, the hallmark symptoms are dryness (xerosis), scaling, and lichenification (a thickening and accentuation of skin lines resulting from repeated scratching). The guideline uses a severity classification of mild, moderate, or severe, based on the extent of these skin lesions and the degree to which the symptoms, particularly the pruritus, impact the patient's quality of life, sleep, and daily functioning.

The foundational management and treatment strategy for all severities of AD is the liberal and frequent use of moisturizers to repair and maintain the skin barrier. For patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by moisturizers alone, the guideline makes a strong recommendation to add a topical corticosteroid (TCS). It further suggests that once-daily application of mid- to high-potency TCS is as effective as twice-daily application. As a first-line alternative, especially for sensitive skin areas like the face or skin folds, the guideline also strongly recommends the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. A key long-term management strategy that receives a strong recommendation is proactive therapy. This involves the intermittent, long-term application of a TCI or a mid-potency TCS to areas of skin that frequently flare, even when they appear clear, to prevent relapses.

For patients with moderate-to-severe AD whose symptoms are not controlled by topical therapies, the guideline provides recommendations on systemic agents. It strongly recommends the use of biologic agents, specifically the monoclonal antibodies dupilumab (for patients aged 6 months and older) and tralokinumab (for patients 12 years and older). These agents target the underlying Type 2 inflammation driving the disease. For patients with severe symptoms who are refractory to or cannot use biologics, the guideline conditionally suggests the use of oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as abrocitinib or upadacitinib, after a careful discussion of their risk-benefit profile. In terms of adjunctive therapies, the guideline conditionally suggests the use of dilute bleach baths for moderate-to-severe AD. It also conditionally suggests considering allergen immunotherapy for patients with AD who have a concomitant sensitization to aeroallergens like house dust mites. Conversely, it suggests against the routine use of elimination diets for the management of AD symptoms due to a lack of clear evidence and potential for nutritional harm.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The guideline issues a prominent safety warning, strongly recommending against the use of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone) for the routine or long-term management of atopic dermatitis symptoms. This is due to the high risk of significant adverse effects with prolonged use and the common phenomenon of a severe rebound flare of the eczema upon discontinuation of the steroid. The recommendations for oral JAK inhibitors are also accompanied by a caution to discuss the FDA's boxed warning regarding potential serious adverse events with patients before initiating therapy.
