Title & Citation: Biologics in severe asthma: a state-of-the-art review. Bishal Gyawali, Steve N. Georas, and Sandhya Khurana. European Respiratory Review. Published online October 24, 2024 (E-pub date, document is for 2025 edition).

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to provide a comprehensive and practical overview of biologic therapies for the management of severe asthma. The authors aim to synthesize the vast body of evidence from key randomized controlled trials (RCTs), subsequent open-label extension studies, and real-world evidence. The scope encompasses the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and known predictors of response for all major classes of asthma biologics. The article is intended to serve as a practical guide for clinicians, helping them navigate the complexities of biologic selection, understand the nuances of each agent, and apply the latest evidence to personalize patient care, with a forward-looking perspective on emerging therapeutic goals like clinical remission.

Patient Population:
The patient population discussed throughout this review is primarily adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma who remain symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one other controller medication, typically a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). The review focuses on specific phenotypes within this population, including those with severe eosinophilic asthma, allergic asthma, and those dependent on oral corticosteroids (OCS). While primarily focused on adults, the principles and biologics discussed often have applications in pediatric populations, though this is not the central focus.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The review begins by outlining the underlying pathophysiology of severe asthma, primarily differentiating between Type 2 (T2)-high and T2-low inflammation. T2-high asthma, which accounts for the majority of severe cases, is driven by cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and is often characterized by elevated biomarkers such as blood eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The biologics discussed are designed to specifically target key components of this T2 inflammatory cascade, offering a more precise approach than broad immunosuppression with oral corticosteroids.

A significant portion of the review is dedicated to a detailed examination of each class of biologic. The first discussed is the anti-IgE therapy, omalizumab. Its mechanism involves binding to circulating IgE, preventing it from activating mast cells and basophils. Pivotal trials demonstrated that omalizumab produces a 25-61% relative risk reduction in the asthma exacerbation rate (AER), alongside improvements in quality of life and reduced healthcare utilization. Predictors for a favorable response to omalizumab include a clear allergic phenotype, childhood-onset asthma, and higher baseline blood eosinophil counts. Next, the anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5Rα therapies—mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab—are detailed. These agents work by targeting IL-5 or its receptor, thereby depleting eosinophils. Clinical trials for this class showed significant efficacy, with mepolizumab reducing AER by 47-53%, reslizumab by 50-59%, and benralizumab by 49-72%. A key feature of this class is a potent oral corticosteroid (OCS)-sparing effect, with many patients in the SIRIUS (mepolizumab) and ZONDA (benralizumab) trials able to significantly reduce or eliminate their maintenance OCS dose. The primary predictor of response for all three agents is a higher baseline blood eosinophil count.

The review then covers dupilumab, an anti-IL-4Rα antibody that blocks the signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13, giving it a broader effect on T2 inflammation than anti-IL-5 agents alone. The pivotal QUEST trial showed dupilumab led to a 46-48% reduction in AER and produced significant improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. A key advantage of dupilumab is its efficacy across a wide range of T2-high patients, including those with or without elevated eosinophils, and its notable positive impact on common comorbidities like atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The final agent discussed is tezepelumab, which targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an upstream "alarmin" cytokine that initiates multiple inflammatory cascades. The landmark NAVIGATOR trial demonstrated a 56% reduction in AER. Because TSLP is positioned so high in the inflammatory pathway, tezepelumab shows efficacy across an even broader population than other biologics, including in some patients with T2-low asthma, making it a valuable option for patients without clear T2 biomarkers.

Beyond individual agents, the article addresses key clinical considerations in practice. It discusses the importance of selecting a biologic based on the patient's specific phenotype, biomarker profile (eosinophils, FeNO, IgE), comorbidities, and preferences. While direct head-to-head trials are limited, the review notes that switching from one biologic class to another is a valid and often effective strategy for patients who do not respond to their initial agent. The concept of "clinical remission" is explored as an emerging therapeutic goal, defined by a composite of outcomes including no exacerbations, stable lung function, no OCS use, and minimal symptoms. Biologics have shown the potential to induce such a state in a subset of patients, representing a paradigm shift in the ambitions of severe asthma management.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The overall safety profile of the reviewed biologics is generally favorable, with long-term extension studies not revealing new safety signals. The most commonly reported adverse events are typically mild and include injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and headaches. Omalizumab carries a boxed warning for anaphylaxis, though this is a rare event. For anti-IL-5 agents, herpes zoster infections have been reported slightly more frequently than with placebo. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions with all monoclonal antibodies.
