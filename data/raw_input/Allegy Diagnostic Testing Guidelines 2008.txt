Guideline Title: Allergy Diagnostic Testing: An Updated Practice Parameter
Publishing Organization & Date: Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) representing the AAAAI, ACAAI, and JCAll. Published March 2008.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this practice parameter is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based reference for clinicians on the use of diagnostic testing for human hypersensitivity diseases. The scope is broad, covering the evaluation of IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity (e.g., allergic rhinitis, food allergy, venom allergy) as well as cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity (e.g., allergic contact dermatitis). The document aims to guide the selection, performance, and interpretation of various in vivo and in vitro tests, integrating technological refinements and their clinical validation to support accurate diagnosis and improve patient care.

Patient Population:
The patient population addressed is extensive, including individuals of all ages—from infants to adults—who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of an allergic disorder. This includes patients with suspected allergies to inhalants (aeroallergens), foods, insect stings, drugs, and chemicals or other substances that cause contactant allergies. The guideline is intended for allergist-immunologists as well as other physicians who encounter patients with these conditions.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The parameter extensively details the clinical presentations that warrant allergic evaluation. For IgE-mediated conditions, this includes a history of symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and ocular itching (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis); wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath (allergic asthma); or urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis (food, drug, or venom allergy). For delayed hypersensitivity, the classic presentation is the pruritic, eczematous, and sometimes vesicular rash of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), which appears hours to days after skin contact with an allergen. The parameter stresses that a thorough clinical history is the most crucial first step in any diagnostic workup, as the pre-test probability of a true allergy, based on the patient's history of symptoms, is critical for interpreting test results.

The diagnostic evaluation pathway is detailed based on the suspected type of hypersensitivity. For immediate IgE-mediated reactions, skin prick testing (SPT) is recommended as the primary, most sensitive, and cost-effective method to detect sensitization. The parameter provides detailed instructions on the technique, including the use of positive (histamine) and negative (saline) controls to ensure test validity. Intradermal testing is discussed as a more sensitive but less specific test, recommended primarily for the evaluation of potential venom and penicillin allergies when SPT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high. For the evaluation of ACD symptoms, patch testing is described as the definitive gold standard. This involves applying standardized allergens to the skin under occlusion for 48 hours and reading the reactions at specific time points thereafter.

The parameter also provides a thorough review of in vitro diagnostic tests. Immunoassays for measuring serum specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies are positioned as a valuable alternative to skin testing, particularly in patients with extensive skin disease, dermographism, or those who cannot discontinue antihistamines. The document cautions that while sIgE tests are highly specific, they may be less sensitive than skin tests, and positive results only indicate sensitization, not necessarily clinical allergy. The clinical relevance of a positive sIgE test must always be correlated with the patient's history of symptoms. Other in vitro tests, such as total IgE, eosinophil counts, and basophil activation tests, are discussed but are generally not recommended for routine primary diagnosis. Finally, the role of organ challenge tests is emphasized as the ultimate diagnostic tool when the combination of history and sensitization tests is inconclusive. This includes oral food challenges (OFC), which are the definitive procedure for diagnosing food allergy, as well as nasal and bronchial challenges for respiratory allergies.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The practice parameter places significant emphasis on safety. All in vivo testing that can potentially induce a systemic allergic reaction, including skin prick testing, intradermal testing, and especially organ challenges, must be performed by trained personnel in a medical facility fully equipped to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The document lists several contraindications to skin testing, including severe or unstable asthma and recent use of interfering medications like antihistamines or tricyclic antidepressants. Pregnancy is considered a relative contraindication for skin testing.
