This document provides a summary of the most current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.  It was created to highlight the important new information and key changes that have emerged since the previous guideline was published, with a significant new focus on the role of shared decision-making between clinicians and patients in managing this condition.  The full guideline is intended for healthcare professionals, but this summary translates the essential points for patients, families, and caregivers. 

Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction that can involve many parts of the body, including the skin, lungs, gut, and cardiovascular system.  It is diagnosed based on a person's clinical signs and symptoms, as there is no single test that can definitively prove a reaction was anaphylaxis.  A doctor may suspect anaphylaxis if someone develops symptoms involving multiple body systems within minutes to hours of being exposed to a potential trigger, such as a food, insect sting, or medication.

A very useful laboratory test that can help support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis is the measurement of a blood marker called serum tryptase.  Tryptase is a chemical released by mast cells during an allergic reaction. For the test to be most helpful, a blood sample should be drawn during the reaction (ideally within two hours of symptom onset) and another sample should be taken later on, once the person is well, to establish their baseline level.  A diagnosis of anaphylaxis is supported if the tryptase level during the acute event is significantly higher than the person's normal baseline level. 

For people who experience recurrent or severe anaphylaxis without a clear cause, known as idiopathic anaphylaxis, the guideline recommends measuring the baseline serum tryptase level.  A consistently elevated baseline tryptase can be a clue to an underlying condition, such as a clonal mast cell disorder (like mastocytosis) or a genetic trait called hereditary alpha-tryptasemia, which can put a person at higher risk for severe reactions.  Doctors may also consider testing for an allergy to alpha-gal, a sugar molecule in red meat that can cause delayed anaphylactic reactions hours after eating. 

Diagnosing anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers can be challenging because they cannot describe their symptoms.  The guideline suggests that doctors and parents should be aware of age-specific signs of a reaction. For example, an infant experiencing oral itching might repeatedly thrust their tongue or rub their mouth, while other general symptoms could include sudden, inconsolable crying or irritability.  While the first allergic reaction an infant has to a new food is unlikely to be anaphylaxis, it is important to recognize these subtle signs. 

The most critical message for managing anaphylaxis is that epinephrine is the first-line, life-saving treatment and must be given without delay.  An injection of epinephrine should be administered at the first sign of a suspected anaphylactic reaction.  A person does not need to meet the full diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis before receiving epinephrine, as delaying treatment is a major risk factor for a fatal outcome.  At the same time, receiving an epinephrine injection does not automatically mean the reaction was anaphylaxis, as the medication is sometimes used for less severe symptoms. 

A major change in this updated guideline concerns what to do after giving epinephrine at home. Previously, it was universally recommended to call 911 and seek emergency care after every use of an epinephrine auto-injector. The new guideline suggests that this may not be necessary in all situations.  If a person has a prompt, complete, and lasting response to the epinephrine injection and has access to additional doses and help if needed, managing the rest of the reaction at home may be appropriate.  This approach requires a careful shared decision-making process between the patient and their doctor ahead of time to create a clear action plan. 

It is crucial to understand when calling for emergency medical services is absolutely required. Emergency help must always be sought immediately if the anaphylaxis is severe, if the symptoms do not resolve quickly and completely after the first dose of epinephrine, or if symptoms begin to return after initially improving.  The decision for home management is only for mild-to-moderate, responsive cases and must be planned in advance with a healthcare professional. 

To prevent future reactions, patients at high risk for anaphylaxis should be counseled to always carry their own epinephrine auto-injectors, as emergency epinephrine is not typically available in public settings.  For food allergies, it is important to know that anaphylaxis is primarily triggered by ingesting the food, and severe reactions from casual skin contact or inhalation are very unlikely unless the food is transferred to the mouth or aerosolized, such as in steam.  In schools, the guideline suggests that staff should be trained in allergy management and that schools should stock undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors for use on anyone experiencing anaphylaxis. 

Another important update addresses the use of common blood pressure and heart medications, specifically beta-blockers (BBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Past concerns that these medications increase the risk or severity of anaphylaxis have not been consistently supported by newer evidence.  The guideline suggests that for most patients who need these medications for an underlying health condition, they can be continued safely, even while receiving allergy treatments like venom immunotherapy (VIT). This decision should always involve a discussion between the patient and doctor about the risks and benefits. 

The most critical safety advice is to never delay the administration of epinephrine when anaphylaxis is suspected.  Although epinephrine has side effects like a racing heart or jitteriness, serious adverse reactions from an intramuscular injection are very rare and should not be a reason to hesitate in an emergency.  Patients and their families must be trained on how to properly store, carry, and use their epinephrine auto-injector and should practice regularly with a trainer device. 

All patients at risk for anaphylaxis should have a clear, written emergency action plan and understand when and how to use their epinephrine. This includes always having access to the device, especially when away from home, and ensuring family, friends, and caregivers also know how to use it. Shared decision-making is a recurring theme, empowering patients to work with their doctors to create a personalized management plan that considers their specific risk factors, the settings where they spend their time, and their comfort level with managing a reaction.
