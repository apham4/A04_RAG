Summary:

This 2022 practice parameter from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters offers an updated, evidence-based guide for clinicians on the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), focusing on significant developments since the 2010 update.  A key theme is the shift towards risk stratification based on the clinical phenotype of the reaction and a greater emphasis on drug challenges over skin testing in many scenarios.  The document provides comprehensive guidance on delabeling penicillin allergies, managing cross-reactivity between antibiotics, and handling reactions to non-antibiotic drugs like aspirin, chemotherapeutics, and biologics. 

The parameter classifies drug HSRs by their timing (immediate or delayed), underlying mechanism (e.g., IgE-mediated, T-cell-mediated), and clinical presentation.  Immediate reactions usually happen within an hour of drug administration, manifesting as urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis, while delayed reactions can develop over days to weeks, ranging from benign rashes to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as DRESS, SJS, and TEN.  The guideline strongly advocates for a proactive approach to "de-labeling" patients with reported penicillin allergies, as incorrect labels often lead to the use of broader-spectrum, more toxic, or less effective antibiotics. 

Diagnostic testing for drug allergies primarily involves skin tests and drug challenges.  Immediate skin testing is particularly useful for patients with a history of anaphylaxis.  For certain delayed HSRs, delayed intradermal tests (dIDT) and patch tests (PT) can be valuable adjunctive tools.  In vitro tests, such as the basophil activation test, are mentioned but are generally considered investigational in the United States.  The parameter also proposes a standardized definition for a positive skin test to improve consistency in diagnosis. 

Drug provocation testing, or drug challenge, is positioned as the gold standard for ruling out a drug allergy when the pre-test probability is low.  The guideline recommends 1- or 2-step challenges for low-risk patients and suggests placebo-controlled challenges for individuals who report subjective symptoms or have multiple drug allergies.  It also clearly outlines contraindications to drug challenges, such as a history of SCARs. 

A substantial portion of the update is dedicated to antibiotic allergies. For penicillin allergy, direct amoxicillin challenges without prior skin testing are now recommended for both pediatric and adult patients with low-risk histories.  The document clarifies that the risk of cross-reactivity between different beta-lactam antibiotics is lower than previously believed and provides updated pathways for administering cephalosporins and carbapenems to penicillin-allergic individuals.  For sulfonamide allergies, direct challenges are favored over desensitization protocols in low-risk cases.  Similarly, for non-anaphylactic reactions to fluoroquinolones or macrolides, a direct 1- or 2-step challenge is recommended without preceding skin tests. 

The parameter provides a new classification for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity, dividing it into four main categories: aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema, NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease, and single NSAID-induced reactions.  For each phenotype, specific management strategies are outlined, often involving the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors as a safe alternative.  A notable change is the recommendation for a 2-step aspirin challenge, rather than desensitization, for patients with a history of non-AERD aspirin allergy who require aspirin for cardiovascular reasons. 

Guidance on managing HSRs to chemotherapy and biologic agents has been significantly expanded.  Drug desensitization is a key management strategy for patients with immediate HSRs who must continue a first-line therapy.  For patients with non-immediate or less convincing histories, management may involve a slowed infusion rate, graded dose escalation, and/or premedication.  The document provides specific recommendations for managing reactions to platins, taxanes, and various monoclonal antibodies, noting that skin testing for mAbs is rarely indicated. 

Finally, the practice parameter touches upon the rare but important issue of excipient-induced allergies, suggesting they be considered in patients who experience anaphylaxis to two or more structurally unrelated drugs that share a common inactive ingredient.  The development of this extensive document was based on a thorough literature review and expert consensus, reflecting the evolving landscape of drug allergy diagnosis and management.  It underscores the importance of a nuanced, individualized approach and shared decision-making in the care of patients with suspected drug allergies.
