The purpose of these guidelines is to provide clear, evidence-based recommendations for the best ways to manage atopic dermatitis, a condition commonly known as eczema, in infants, children, and adults.  This update was necessary because many new and effective treatments have become available since the last major guideline was released in 2012, and the methods used to create and evaluate medical evidence have significantly improved.  A central theme of the new guideline is the importance of "shared decision-making," a process where patients, families, and clinicians work together to select the best treatment plan by considering the scientific evidence, the patient's lifestyle, and what is most important to them. 

The guideline is intended for a wide audience, including patients of all ages who live with atopic dermatitis, their families, and the various healthcare providers who care for them.  This includes specialists like allergists and dermatologists, as well as primary care clinicians such as family doctors and pediatricians.  The recommendations cover the full spectrum of the disease, from mild cases to moderate and severe ones, ensuring that the guidance is relevant for anyone affected by the condition.

Doctors typically identify atopic dermatitis based on a patient's symptoms and history, as there is no single test to diagnose it.  The most defining feature is having an itchy skin condition.  Doctors will also look for a pattern of rash that appears in typical locations for eczema, such as in the creases of the elbows and knees, or on the cheeks and outer limbs of young children.  Other key signs that point to atopic dermatitis include having a history of generally dry skin, a personal or family background of other atopic diseases like asthma or allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and the condition starting before the age of two. 

The guideline emphasizes that all treatment should begin with a strong foundation of basic care, outlined in what is called a "Good Practice Statement."  Before starting any new medication, a clinician should first ensure the diagnosis is correct, provide education about the disease, and create an action plan for managing flare-ups.  It is also important to discuss potential triggers that could be making the eczema worse and to make sure the patient is using their current medications properly.  The most critical step in this foundation is the regular, daily use of a bland moisturizer, which is a simple cream or ointment without fragrances or other potential allergens.  The guideline stresses that the best moisturizer is whichever one a patient finds acceptable and will use consistently. 

For eczema that doesn't get better with moisturizers alone, the guideline discusses topical treatments, which are medications applied directly to the skin. It strongly recommends using topical corticosteroids (TCS), a type of anti-inflammatory steroid cream, to control flare-ups.  As an alternative, it also strongly recommends topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), which are a different kind of non-steroid anti-inflammatory cream that are also very effective and safe.  The document also notes that applying these medications just once a day is often as effective as twice a day for many patients, which can make the routine simpler and easier to follow.  The panel suggests against using expensive prescription moisturizers because there is not enough evidence to show they are better than standard, over-the-counter options. 

A key strategy for managing atopic dermatitis and preventing future problems is called "proactive" or "maintenance" therapy.  This approach is recommended for people who experience a relapsing course of eczema.  It involves applying a mid-potency topical corticosteroid or a topical calcineurin inhibitor to the areas of skin that tend to flare up regularly.  This is done intermittently, such as on two consecutive days each week (like on weekends), even when the skin appears clear and calm.  This strategy has been proven to significantly reduce the frequency of flares and lessen the overall amount of medication needed over the long term. 

The guideline also provides advice on other types of treatments. For patients with moderate-to-severe eczema, it suggests that adding dilute bleach baths to their routine may provide a small but helpful benefit.  However, for those with only mild eczema, this is not recommended because the benefit is likely too small to be worth the trouble.  The document also suggests that allergen immunotherapy, which includes treatments like allergy shots or under-the-tongue drops, could be a helpful option for people with moderate-to-severe eczema who are also allergic to airborne allergens like dust mites.

One of the most critical safety messages in the guideline relates to diet. It strongly suggests against the use of elimination diets, where a person avoids certain foods like milk, eggs, or peanuts in an attempt to improve their eczema.  This is because the evidence shows these diets provide very little, if any, benefit for eczema, but they can cause significant harm.  For young children, avoiding a food can prevent their body from learning to tolerate it, which can lead to the development of a new, potentially lifelong food allergy.  Such diets can also lead to nutritional deficiencies and be very burdensome for families to follow. 

For patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that does not improve with topical treatments, the guideline recommends systemic therapies, which are medications that work throughout the entire body.  It gives a strong recommendation for using biologics, which are modern, targeted medicines given by injection. Specifically, it recommends dupilumab for adults and children aged 6 months and older, and tralokinumab for those aged 12 years and older. These medications have been shown to be very effective at improving symptoms like itch and sleep loss and have a good safety record, although they can sometimes cause conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the surface of the eye. 

The guideline also discusses a class of oral medications called JAK inhibitors. It suggests that these pills can be an option for adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe eczema who have not found relief with other systemic treatments, like biologics.  This is a "conditional" recommendation because, while these drugs can be very effective, they come with significant safety considerations.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a "Boxed Warning" for this class of drugs because of an increased risk of serious infections, major cardiovascular events (like heart attack or stroke), cancer, and blood clots that were observed in studies.  Because of these potential risks, a thorough conversation between the patient and their doctor is essential to weigh the benefits against the possible harms. 

Another major safety point is the recommendation against the routine use of systemic corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone pills, for managing eczema. Although these drugs can offer rapid relief from a flare, the improvement is often short-lived, and the eczema frequently returns, sometimes even more severely, after the medication is stopped.  Furthermore, frequent or long-term use of these steroids is linked to a wide range of serious side effects, including weight gain, high blood pressure, bone thinning (osteoporosis), infections, and adrenal gland problems.
