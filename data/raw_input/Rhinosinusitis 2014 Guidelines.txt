This practice parameter provides an updated, comprehensive guide for doctors on how to diagnose and manage rhinosinusitis, a condition commonly known as a sinus infection. It was created to reflect new scientific insights and to help clinicians make the best decisions for patients suffering from this very common and impactful disease. The guideline covers the different types of rhinosinusitis, the role of associated conditions like allergies and asthma, and the appropriate use of medical and surgical treatments for both adults and children.

The guideline first clarifies the different classifications of rhinosinusitis, a term preferred over sinusitis because inflammation of the sinuses almost always involves inflammation of the nose.  Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is defined as having symptoms for less than 12 weeks.  When it's caused by bacteria, it is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) refers to having three or more episodes of ABRS in a year.  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is diagnosed when symptoms last for 12 weeks or longer and is confirmed with objective evidence of sinus inflammation, such as from an endoscopy or a CT scan.  CRS is further divided into two types: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). 

A diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is typically made based on a patient's symptoms and a physical exam, without the need for imaging in uncomplicated cases.  ABRS should be suspected when the symptoms of a common cold last for more than 10 days, or when symptoms initially get better and then suddenly worsen.  The most common signs include a combination of thick, purulent (colored) nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and facial pain or pressure.  In children, a persistent cough is also a very prominent symptom. 

For chronic rhinosinusitis, the symptoms can be more subtle and may include persistent nasal congestion, facial fullness or pressure, and a decreased sense of smell.  Unlike acute sinusitis, a diagnosis of CRS requires objective proof of sinus inflammation.  The imaging technique of choice for this is a computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses, which provides a detailed view of the sinus anatomy and any blockages or mucosal thickening.  A CT scan is required before any surgical intervention is considered. 

In any patient with recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis, it is important to evaluate for underlying conditions that may be contributing to the problem. The guideline recommends that these patients be evaluated for allergies to airborne substances like dust mites, pollen, or mold, as allergic rhinitis is a very common coexisting condition.  For patients whose CRS is resistant to typical medical and surgical treatment, an evaluation for an immunodeficiency should be considered.  In children with nasal polyps, testing for cystic fibrosis is also an important step. 

For treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, a 10- to 14-day course of an appropriate antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, is often recommended.  However, the guideline also raises strong concerns about the overuse of antibiotics for viral upper respiratory infections and emphasizes that antibiotics should be reserved for cases where a bacterial infection is likely.  In addition to antibiotics, intranasal corticosteroid (INS) sprays are recommended to help reduce inflammation in the nasal passages. 

The management of chronic rhinosinusitis focuses on controlling the underlying inflammation rather than just infection. The primary and most strongly recommended medical therapy is the long-term use of intranasal corticosteroid sprays, which are effective for CRS both with and without nasal polyps.  Daily use of a nasal saline irrigation, which involves rinsing the nasal passages with a salt-water solution, is also recommended as a helpful adjunctive therapy to clear mucus and irritants from the nose and sinuses. 

For more difficult cases of chronic disease, other treatments may be necessary. A short course of oral steroids is very effective for shrinking nasal polyps in patients with CRSwNP and can provide significant symptom relief.  For patients with CRS who also have aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), a treatment called aspirin desensitization can be very beneficial for both their sinus and asthma symptoms.  When medical treatments fail to provide adequate relief, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) may be considered to remove diseased tissue, clear blockages, and improve sinus drainage. 

While rhinosinusitis is usually not a medical emergency, there are rare but serious complications that require immediate medical attention. Any patient who develops swelling or severe pain around the eye, vision changes such as double vision, swelling of the forehead, a severe headache with a stiff neck, or confusion should seek urgent medical evaluation.  These symptoms could indicate that the sinus infection has spread to the eye socket or the brain, which can be life-threatening and may require immediate hospitalization and surgery. 

One of the most important safety messages in the guideline is to be cautious with antibiotic use to help combat the growing problem of bacterial resistance.  It is also critical that patients who perform nasal saline irrigations use only distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water to prepare the solution.  This is because using contaminated tap water has been linked to rare but fatal brain infections caused by an amoeba called Naegleria fowleri.  Finally, a one-sided chronic sinus problem, especially if it doesn't respond to treatment, should always be thoroughly investigated with imaging to rule out an underlying tumor or other serious issue.
