Guideline Title: EAACI Allergen Immunotherapy User's Guide
Publishing Organization & Date: European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). Published online 2020.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this user's guide is to provide a comprehensive and practical overview of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for healthcare professionals, with a specific focus on its application in children. The scope of the document covers AIT for both inhalant allergies, which cause allergic rhinitis and asthma, and for insect venom allergies. It aims to bridge the gap between scientific research and daily clinical practice by summarizing the mechanisms of AIT, detailing its clinical applications and efficacy, discussing the role of biomarkers in patient selection, and exploring the long-term preventive effects of treatment.

Patient Population:
The patient population addressed in this guide is exclusively children and adolescents with diagnosed IgE-mediated allergic diseases. This includes children with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or allergic asthma driven by sensitization to common aeroallergens like pollens, house dust mites, and animal dander. It also specifically covers the population of children who have experienced a systemic allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a Hymenoptera (bee or wasp) sting and are candidates for venom immunotherapy. The guide is intended for use by pediatricians, allergists, and other specialists managing these conditions.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The guide provides a detailed overview of the clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation for children who are candidates for AIT. The typical patient presents with symptoms of allergic rhinitis, such as recurrent sneezing, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal or ocular pruritus, which are temporally associated with exposure to a specific allergen. Alternatively, they may have symptoms of allergic asthma, including wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath, triggered by the same allergens. For venom allergy, the key presentation is a history of a systemic reaction beyond a large local swelling, involving symptoms like generalized urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, or hypotension following a sting. The guide emphasizes the importance of confirming IgE sensitization to the suspected trigger. It strongly advocates for a modern molecular diagnostic approach using Component-Resolved Diagnosis (CRD), especially for polysensitized patients. CRD helps to identify the primary sensitizing allergen molecule versus cross-reactive components, allowing for a more precise and targeted prescription of immunotherapy.

For treatment and management, the guide details the two primary routes of AIT administration: subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Both are presented as effective and safe options for children with allergic rhinitis and well-controlled allergic asthma. The choice between SCIT (injections) and SLIT (drops or tablets under the tongue) should be individualized based on the specific allergen, the availability of high-quality standardized products, family preference and ability to adhere to the regimen, and cost considerations. A standard course of AIT is recommended to last for a duration of three to five years to achieve not only symptom control during treatment but also long-term, post-treatment tolerance and disease modification. Regular follow-up is stressed as essential to monitor adherence, assess clinical benefit, and manage any potential side effects.

A significant portion of the guide is dedicated to the long-term and preventative effects of AIT. A key conclusion is that AIT has a demonstrated preventive effect on the future development of asthma in children who initially present only with allergic rhinitis due to pollen allergy. This disease-modifying benefit has been shown to persist for at least two years after the completion of the immunotherapy course. The guide also highlights the exceptional efficacy of venom immunotherapy (VIT), which is protective against future anaphylactic reactions in a very high percentage of treated children, making it a life-saving intervention for this population. The guide also discusses the role of biomarkers in monitoring treatment, noting that while changes in specific IgE and IgG4 levels are observed, they do not consistently correlate with clinical outcomes in individual patients, and therefore routine monitoring is not recommended outside of research settings. The document concludes by underscoring that AIT is a specialized treatment that should be prescribed and supervised by physicians with expertise in allergy.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
AIT is a generally safe procedure when administered correctly, but it carries a risk of allergic reactions. Local reactions at the injection site for SCIT or oral itching with SLIT are common and typically mild. The primary safety concern is the risk of a systemic reaction, which can range from mild urticaria to severe anaphylaxis. This risk is notably higher with SCIT than with SLIT. For this reason, SCIT must be administered in a medical facility equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and patients must be observed for at least 30 minutes after each injection. Absolute contraindications for initiating AIT include having uncontrolled asthma, active autoimmune disease, or any malignancy.
