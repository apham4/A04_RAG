Guideline Title: Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (2025 Update)
Publishing Organization & Date: Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Updated May 2025.

Scope and Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and continually updated global strategy for the management and prevention of asthma. Its scope is to provide evidence-based recommendations for both diagnosis and treatment that can be adapted for use in diverse healthcare settings worldwide. The strategy aims to reduce the global burden of asthma by promoting a control-based management approach that minimizes symptom burden and reduces the future risk of adverse outcomes like exacerbations and lung function decline.

Patient Population:
The patient population covered by the GINA strategy is extensive, encompassing individuals of all ages, from children 5 years and younger to adolescents and adults. The recommendations are designed to be applicable across the entire spectrum of asthma severity, from mild, infrequent symptoms to severe, refractory disease. It is intended for use by a wide range of healthcare providers, from primary care physicians to pulmonary specialists, as well as for public health officials and policymakers.

Core Content (Detailed Multi-Paragraph Breakdown):
The GINA strategy defines asthma by its characteristic clinical presentation of variable respiratory symptoms, which most commonly include wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. A key aspect of this symptomatology is its variability over time and in intensity. The diagnosis is confirmed by documenting variable expiratory airflow limitation, with spirometry showing significant bronchodilator responsiveness being the preferred method. The guideline emphasizes a personalized, control-based management cycle that involves continuous assessment of both symptom control and future risk factors, followed by treatment adjustment and review of the patient's response.

The cornerstone of the GINA treatment recommendation is a five-step algorithm presented in two distinct pathways, or "tracks," for adults and adolescents. Track 1 is the preferred pathway because it is proven to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations. Its central principle is the use of a combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol inhaler as the single reliever for all steps. In Step 1 and 2 (mild asthma), patients use as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol alone. In Steps 3 through 5 (moderate to severe asthma), patients use daily maintenance ICS-formoterol and also use the same inhaler for as-needed relief of symptoms (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy, or MART). This ensures that whenever a reliever is used, the patient also receives an anti-inflammatory ICS dose. Track 2 is the alternative pathway, which uses a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for symptom relief. In this track, patients must be prescribed a separate daily ICS-containing controller from Step 2 onwards to manage inflammation.

For patients who remain uncontrolled despite maximal therapy in Step 4 (e.g., medium-dose ICS-LABA), they are moved to Step 5. This involves referral to a specialist for phenotypic assessment and consideration of add-on therapies. These therapies are targeted and include Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists (LAMAs) or, for patients with specific inflammatory profiles, biologic agents such as those targeting IgE, IL-5, IL-4, or TSLP. The guideline also provides detailed, separate recommendations for the management of asthma in children aged 6-11 and for children 5 years and younger, with treatment algorithms adapted for these age groups. Throughout all populations, the use of a personalized written asthma action plan is strongly recommended to guide self-management of worsening symptoms.

Key Safety Warnings & Contraindications:
The most prominent safety warning issued throughout the GINA guideline is the strong recommendation against the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents with short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA) alone. Decades of evidence have shown that regular or frequent use of SABA without a concurrent ICS increases the risk of severe, life-threatening exacerbations and asthma-related mortality. The promotion of ICS-containing relievers in Track 1 is a direct strategy to mitigate this risk by ensuring patients receive anti-inflammatory medication whenever they experience symptoms.
